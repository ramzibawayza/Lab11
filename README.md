This page should display three random products for a USER to choose between, and log which product the user clicks on. It will then display three more random products to repeat this process until 25 products have been selected, at which point it will display the data received thus far, or the user can continue to select products. Clicking the button will render either a list of each product along with the number of times it was clicked, number of times it displayed.
